# EducationalPBPKStandalone

This is a standalone version of [our educational PBPK app, PBPKedu](https://github.com/SystemsForecasting/ManchesterPBPK).  
Windows 10 and 11 are the only supported OS.  
To install the PBPKedu app, follow these steps.  

1. Dowload `installer_PBPKedu_windows10.exe` (despite the name it should work for Windows 11 as well).
2. Open (double click) `installer_PBPKedu_windows10.exe`.
3. Allow the app to make changes on the device.
4. Select the app location, default should be `C:\Program Files (x86)\PBPKedu`.
5. Tick create desktop shortcut.
6. Continue and press install.

In a few minutes the app should be installed and a '90s style `PBPKedu` icon should appear on your desktop. Open the app: you should see PBPKedu opened in your default web browser.  
Enjoy!
